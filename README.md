## Current Issue: Heroku Setup for Spring Boot

One of the primary challenges Reservify is facing right now is setting up Heroku for the Spring Boot backend. Despite efforts to configure and deploy the application, compatibility issues and configuration errors have hindered the deployment process. Resolving these issues is critical for deploying Reservify on Heroku and making the application accessible to users. The development team is actively working on troubleshooting and resolving the deployment issues to ensure a smooth and successful deployment on Heroku.

## GitHub Actions Deployment

On a positive note, Reservify has successfully utilized GitHub Actions to deploy the frontend of the application. The frontend is currently accessible at https://anupam-1068.github.io/reservify/. However, achieving full deployment on Heroku remains a priority.

If you have any suggestions or expertise in Heroku deployment for Spring Boot applications, your contribution and insights would be greatly appreciated in overcoming this challenge and ensuring the successful deployment of Reservify.
